            <h3>Whats your favourite comfort media?</h3>
            <p>I would anytime,anywhere choose music as my comfort media I guess.Music has always been there for me at
                all kind of situation whether happy,sad,excited or anxious.It kinda heals,comforts at times speaks for
                us.</p>
            <p>Not feeling good;Plug in your airpods,sit there,stare at the ceiling and blast some music-The best
                therapy I would suggest</p>
            <p> And not to mention- reading has not always been my cup of tea until I found that it was the only way to
                escape reality and drown into a whole new world.When reality hits hard I wish u go take a diversion and
                delve deep into the world of fantasies,sorrow,adventure,romance,crime through books.</p>
            <p> When you read sad books,You will forget your sorrows and find yourself mourning for the characters in
                your book instead -IRONY.</p>
            <p> I realized books were a part of my comfort media only after sometime,when I seriously was in need of
                some kinda diversion.Now,I seriously do regret I would have better started reading earlier.</p>

            <h3>What genre is the most loved among readers?</h3>
            <p>As of now with all the booktok hype,I would really say that people are much into romance these days.</p>
            <p> I don't entirely hate romance as a genre,but sometimes I do kinda envy the hype created around romance
                books.I wish people also talk about other books as much as they do about romance.</p>
            <p>But I ain't a exception and I end up buying books mentioned in booktoks just for the single line quoted
                :)</p>
            <p>But if u ask me sad books are my favourite kinda books ;)</p>

            <h3>Who needs any kind of books,movies,or series?</h3 <p>The answer is different for different people i
            guess.According to me not everyone needs books,movies or series to keep them entertained.Some prefer music
            some prefer doing their work some do cooking ……. the list goes on, so there are various options out there to
            keep people engaged.</p>
            <p>But I do agree most of the people nowadays especially during and after lockdowns have
            started watching various shows,films and atleast some… do read books. So to answer your question straight,
            people who are bored or wanna take a break from their monotonous routine prefer movies,books,series while
            others do have other options.
